# Real Order System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete order management system that stores orders in the database and displays them in both the user's "My Orders" page and the admin dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
Added two new tables:

#### **Orders Table**
- `id` - Primary key (serial)
- `customerId` - Foreign key to users table
- `status` - Order status (pending, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- `total` - Total order amount
- `subtotal` - Subtotal before tax
- `tax` - Tax amount (5% GST)
- `shippingAddress` - Full shipping address
- `shippingCity` - City
- `shippingState` - State
- `shippingZip` - PIN code
- `shippingPhone` - Contact phone
- `paymentMethod` - Payment method used
- `notes` - Optional order notes
- `createdAt` - Order creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

#### **Order Items Table**
- `id` - Primary key (serial)
- `orderId` - Foreign key to orders table
- `productId` - Foreign key to products table (optional)
- `productName` - Product name at time of order
- `productImage` - Product image URL
- `quantity` - Quantity ordered
- `price` - Price at time of order
- `unit` - Unit of measurement (kg, liter, etc.)
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp

### 2. Storage Methods (`server/storage.database.ts`)
Implemented the following methods:

#### **Order Creation**
- `createOrder(orderData)` - Creates new order with items
  - Inserts order into orders table
  - Inserts all order items into orderItems table
  - Returns created order

#### **Order Retrieval**
- `getUserOrders(userId)` - Fetches all orders for a specific user
  - Joins orders with orderItems
  - Returns formatted order data with items
  
- `getAllOrders()` - Fetches all orders (admin use)
  - Joins orders with orderItems and users
  - Includes customer information
  - Returns complete order details

- `getOrder(orderId)` - Fetches single order by ID
  - Returns order with all items

#### **Order Updates**
- `updateOrderStatus(orderId, status)` - Updates order status
  - Used for order tracking and status changes

### 3. API Endpoints (`server/routes.ts`)

#### **User Endpoints**
- **GET `/api/orders`** (authenticated)
  - Fetches all orders for logged-in user
  - Returns orders with items and shipping info

- **POST `/api/orders`** (authenticated)
  - Creates new order from cart data
  - Calculates tax (5% GST for India)
  - Saves order and items to database
  - Emits Socket.IO notification to admins
  - Returns order confirmation

#### **Admin Endpoints**
- **GET `/api/admin/orders`** (admin only)
  - Fetches all orders from all users
  - Includes customer details
  - Used in admin dashboard

### 4. Frontend Updates

#### **Orders Page (`src/pages/orders.tsx`)**
- Removed mock data completely
- Fetches real orders from `/api/orders` API
- Displays:
  - Order ID
  - Order date
  - Order status with colored badges
  - Order total in ₹
  - Order items with images
  - Shipping address
  - Action buttons (View Details, Reorder, Track Package)
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Shows empty state if no orders
- Properly handles errors

### 5. Database Migration
Created and applied migration:
- **Migration**: `0004_add_orders_tables.sql`
- **Tables Created**: `orders`, `order_items`
- **Foreign Keys**: 
  - orders → users (customerId)
  - order_items → orders (orderId)
  - order_items → products (productId, optional)

## Features

## Data Flow

### Order Creation Flow
```
1. User adds items to cart
2. User proceeds to checkout
3. Frontend sends POST /api/orders with:
   - Cart items
   - Shipping information
   - Payment method
4. Backend:
   - Validates data
   - Calculates subtotal, tax (5%), and total
   - Creates order in database
   - Creates order items in database
   - Emits Socket.IO notification
   - Returns order confirmation
5. Frontend redirects to order success page
6. Cart is cleared
```

### Order Retrieval Flow
```
1. User visits "My Orders" page
2. Frontend sends GET /api/orders
3. Backend:
   - Verifies authentication
   - Fetches user's orders from database
   - Joins with order items
   - Formats data for frontend
4. Frontend displays orders with items
```

## Tax Calculation
- **GST Rate**: 5% (simplified for demo)
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  subtotal = sum of (price × quantity) for all items
  tax = subtotal × 0.05
  total = subtotal + tax
  ```

## Real-time Notifications
When a new order is placed, admins receive real-time Socket.IO notification:
```javascript
{
  event: 'admin:new-order',
  data: {
    id: orderId,
    customerId: userId,
    customer: username,
    total: orderTotal,
    timestamp: ISO timestamp
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Order Creation
1. Login as customer
2. Add products to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Fill shipping information
5. Select payment method
6. Place order
7. Check "My Orders" page - order should appear

### Test Admin View
1. Login as admin
2. Go to admin dashboard
3. Click "Orders" tab
4. All orders from all users should be visible

## Database Queries

### Get User Orders
```sql
SELECT o.*, oi.*
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE o.customer_id = ?
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
```

### Get All Orders (Admin)
```sql
SELECT o.*, oi.*, u.username, u.email
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
JOIN users u ON o.customer_id = u.id
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Order cancellation by user
2. Order editing before confirmation
3. Delivery tracking with map
4. Email notifications for order updates
5. Invoice generation
6. Order search and filtering
7. Export orders to CSV/PDF
8. Order analytics and reports
9. Refund management
10. Multiple shipping addresses

## Notes
- All prices are stored and displayed in Indian Rupees (₹)
- Tax is calculated at 5% (simplified GST)
- Orders cannot be deleted, only cancelled
- Order history is permanent
- Product information is stored in order items to preserve pricing at time of purchase
- Payment processing is simulated (no real payment gateway integrated yet)
